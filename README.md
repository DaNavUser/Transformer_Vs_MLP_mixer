**Attached are the results for the mixer on the CIFAR10 CIFAR100 and the SVHN datasets. We can see that the optimal ratio is always greater than 1 as claimed.**

Comment-1: We choose smaller budgets for easier datasets to prevent overfit. 

Comment-2: Additionally the SVHN results have higher variance so it is possible that also for this data the optimal ratio is exactly 1. 
Nevertheless, the ratio > 1 still aligns with the paper result and as stated in Remark 5.2, 
we leave the question of exact equality open for further research.
