Results for mixer on the CIFAR10 CIFAR100 and the SVHN datasets 
we can see that the optimal ratio is always greater > 1 
as claimed.

We choose smaller budgets for easier datasets to prevent overfit. 

Comment: Additionaly the SVHN results have higher variance so it possible that also for this data 
the optimal ratio is exactly 1. But in anycase it still align with the paper result that the ratio > 1. 
And as said in Remark 5.2 that we leave the exact equality question open for further research.
